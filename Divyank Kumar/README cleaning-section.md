## Challenges Faced

While working on the development of the web page, I faced numerous challenges, particularly when dealing with the responsiveness of images and managing overlapping elements. Additionally, crafting a design layout that seamlessly accommodates various products posed another set of hurdles. Ensuring that the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and devices added complexity to the task of making the webpage responsive
